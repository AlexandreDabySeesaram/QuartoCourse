## Github pages

As mentionned [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) quarto works well with github pages.


1. Create a repository
2. Clone it 
3. Add a minimal quarto website (`_quarto.yml` and `index.qmd`)
4. Add `public/*` to the `.gitignore`
5. Commit the changes
6. run `quarto publish gh-pages`
7. Add the `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file
8. On your gh repository you can change the default branch to the main one 

Et voil√†, you're ready to go, every new commit will automatically be published on you website !
